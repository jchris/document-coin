Crypto Currency for the Gift Economy

This is an experimental project with more unknown unknowns than you can shake a stick at. Do not use it to run your business, unless your business is experimental JavaScript crypto "currency" games.

Document Coin implements a signature-based data provenance tracking system. Restrictions on how viral a given coin can be are configured per-coin by the person who mints the coin.

To run the test suite:

```
npm install
npm test
```

### Help wanted.
